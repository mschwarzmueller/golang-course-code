Time to practice what you learned!

1) Create a new Go code file and initialize it correctly.

2) Add two new variables to the file:
  - The number PI (3.14)
  - A circle radius with a value of 5

3) Calculate the circle circumference (2*PI*radius) and store it in a new variable.
  Output that value in the command line. Make sure that the value is correct!
  Side-note: The result may have a tiny precision issue - you can ignore that.

4) Switch to a different way of outputting the result: Format the string to say
  "For a radius of X, the circle circumference is Y.YY". X and Y should be concrete values.
  Hint: You might need to look into https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#hdr-Printing to learn how to
  output two decimal places (or scroll to the bottom of this file).























You can format a floating point number to be output as Y.YY (two decimal places) via
the %.2f placeholder in a formatted string.
