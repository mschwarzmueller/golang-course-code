# Golang - The Practical Guide

This code repository holds code snapshots for my complete [Golang - The Practical Guide course](https://acad.link/golang).

# How To Use

The different [branches](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/golang-course-code/branches) in this repository reflect the different course sections - every course section has a corresponsing branch that contains the source code snapshots (and other resources) for that branch.

Inside the branches, you find various resources that belong to the corresponding course section:

- A `/code` folder which contains various subfolders that carry lecture names (or names that make mapping them to lectures easy): Those are **different code snapshots for different lectures** of that section.
- A `/slides` folder that contains slides for that course section (if slides were used in that section)
- An `/extra-files` folder that contains any extra files that are needed at some point in the course section

For example, the folder [01-exploring-variables](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/golang-course-code/tree/02-basics/code/01-exploring-variables) in branch [02-basics](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/golang-course-code/tree/02-basics) contains the code snapshot for the lecture named "Exploring Variables" in the second course section (which is named "Go Basics: Values, Variables, Types").
